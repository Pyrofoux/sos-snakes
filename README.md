# SOS Snakes

Made for the [Ludum Dare 36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=4440).

SOS Snake is a dynamic platformer mixed with a good old Snake to create a new hardcore action-puzzle game ! You can play it locally with a friend, or all by yourself if you want a good challenge.  
  
Controls :
