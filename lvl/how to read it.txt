* -> empty
0 -> wall
any int != 0 -> head of the snake with it's défault size
+ -> power up for the snake (to get bigger)
S -> spawn of the guy (let's name him Saidijo)
G -> the goal of Saidijo
D -> Anything that kills Saidijo (spikes, lava, ...we'll choose later)

Snake dies when it hits any wall, or itself, or D (?)
Saidijo can uses + as a plateform. It forces the player to use snake to open som access to Saidijo, but making him bigger so harder for the player to keep alive.
